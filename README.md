# Phelix2015
Code for our 2015 FIRST Recycle Rush robot, codenamed Phelix

Hey you cool cats, welcome to Ice Cubed's Code repository for 2015!

Our code uses command based java, meaning everything is in small files.
If you need to know what a file is, every part of the code has some javadoc which will explain.

We're competing at GTR-E, Waterloo, and North Bay, if you'd like to know more try to find Mac Willis or Mr. Belanger!
Ask us about our algorithms, we're really proud of them!



Thanks for visiting, have some ice cream.
